# **Part 1**: (60 pts) Theory

\

## **(6 pts)** Git Concepts

\

**Q1 (2 pts)** What's the difference between using `git add` vs `git commit`?

\
\
\
\
\
\

**Q2** Assume you are on a repository with one remote (origin) and with the following branches: 

* `master`
* `working-branch-1`
* `working-branch-2`
* `solutions`

You are currently on `working-branch-2`. Do the following:

* **(0.5 pts)** Update your local `master` branch with the changes from the "origin" remote. 
* **(0.5 pts)** Create a new branch from `master` named `working-branch-3`.
* **(0.5 pts)** Merge `solutions` into the new branch. 
* **(0.5 pts)** Push your changes into the "origin" remote. 

\
\
\
\
\
\

**Q3 (2 pts)** Assume you are in a repository with multiple remotes: 

* `origin`
* `upstream`

Each remote contains a branch named `common`. How can you update the 
`common` branch from `origin` with the latest changes from the `upstream` `common` branch?

## **(6 pts)** Python Applications

\

**Q4 (2 pts)** What's a python virtualenv and why is it useful?

\
\
\
\
\
\

**Q5 (1 pts)** The python virtual machine uses a "stack-based" execution method. Describe how a "stack" works and briefly explain
 how python uses that data structure? 
 
 Hint: an stack-overflow error can occur over multiple recursive calls of the same function. 

\
\
\
\
\
\

**Q6 (1 pts for each)** Name and describe at least 3 files (scripts) we use on a python project.

* 
\
\
\
* 
\
\
\

**Q9 (2 pts)** Describe the difference between classes and objects:

\   
\   
\   
\   
\

**Q12 (1 pts)** Where in the code can you make use of private methods?

\
\

## **(15 pts)** OOP in Python

\

Consider the following `Human` class with two sub-classes named `Student` and `Professor`.

\   

`Human` class definition: 

\   

```python
import datetime as dt

STRING_FORMAT_DATE = "%Y-%m-%d"


class Human:

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, **kwargs):
        self.date_of_birth = dt.datetime.strptime(date_of_birth, STRING_FORMAT_DATE)
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"
        self._kwargs = kwargs

    @property
    def age(self):
        today, dob = dt.datetime.today(), self.date_of_birth
        adjust = (today.month, today.day) < (self.dob.month, self.dob.day)
        return today.year - self.dob.year - adjust
    
    
    def greeting(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Greeting method is not implemented")
```

\newpage

Child class `Student` definition: 

\

```python
class Student(Human):
    notebook_name = "notes"

    @property
    def notes(self):
        return self._kwargs.get(self.notebook_name, "")

    def add_note(self, note):
        notes_content = self.notes + note
        self._kwargs[self.notebook_name] = notes_content

    def greeting(self):
        return "My name is {student_name} and I'm {student_age} years old.".format(
            student_name=self.full_name, student_age=self.age)
```

Child class `Professor` definition: 

\   

```python
class Professor(Human):

    @property
    def lecture(self):
        return self._kwargs.get("lecture")

    def assign_lecture(self, lecture_name, override=False, fail=True):
        FAIL_MESSAGE = f"Cannot assign lecture {lecture_name} to professor " + \
                        f"{self.full_name} because {self.lecture} was previously assigned."
        if not self.lecture or override:
            self._kwargs["lecture"] = lecture_name
        elif not fail:
            print(FAIL_MESSAGE)
        else:
            raise ValueError(FAIL_MESSAGE)
        
    def greeting(self):
        return "I'm Prof. {professor_last_name} and {lecture_details}.".format(
            professor_last_name=self.last_name,
            lecture_details=f"I am teaching a lecture named '{self.lecture}'" 
                if self.lecture else "I am currently not teaching any lecture")
```

\

**Q13 (0.5 pts each)** What are the common attributes between `Student` and `Professor`? Name at least 4.

* 
* 
* 
*

\newpage

**Q14 (1 pts)** Identify one common method between `Student` and `Professor`:

* Common method:

\

**Q15 (1.5 pts for each)** Identify one distinct method for each class: 

* `Student`:
* `Professor`:

\

**Q16 (3 pts)** What does the `@property` decorator does in this context?

\
\
\
\
\
\

Given this code snippet: 

```python

# Create professor object
professor = Professor(
    first_name="Erwin", 
    last_name="SchrÃ¶dinger",
    date_of_birth="1887-08-12"
)

# A) First greeting
greeting_a = professor.greeting()

# B) Second greeting
professor.assign_lecture(lecture_name="Quantum Mechanics", fail=False)
greeting_b = professor.greeting()

# C) Third greeting
professor.assign_lecture(lecture_name="Probability Theory", fail=False)
greeting_c = professor.greeting()

```

Write out the value of the following variables: 

* **Q17 (3 pts)** Value of `greeting_a`: 
\
* **Q18 (3 pts)** Value if `greeting_c`:

\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\

def get_random(a: int, b: int):
    return random.randint(a, b)
```

# **Part 2**: (40 pts) Coding

\

## **(40 pts)** flatten-json

\

Please follow the instructions on the `flatten-json` project.
\

* Project structure, best practices, and minimal functionality.
    * **Q28 (3 pts)** `(a)` - the `main.py` file is configured correctly (fire + logging)
    * **Q29 (6 pts)** `(b)` - the recursive `flatten_dict` function works as expected or at least on most cases.
    * **Q30 (6 pts)** `(c)` - the commands are reachable via the CLI and work as intended. 
\
* **Q31 (25 pts)** Correct execution of all the examples AND the secret tests.
